# Basic Calculator App

Welcome to the **Basic Calculator App** repository! This project is a simple calculator application built using Kotlin. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Addition**: Add two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
- **Division**: Divide one number by another.
- **Clear Button**: Reset the calculation and start over.
- **Responsive UI**: User-friendly design and responsive layout for various screen sizes.
